    // constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a
    // function call or any other value that could only be computed at runtime.

    // it is different from `x = x + 1`

    println!("x = {}", x);

    // Rust has 4 scalar types:
    // - integer
    // - Boolean
    // - floating-point numbers
    // - characters

    // Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2n - 1) to 2n - 1 - 1 inclusive,
    // where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store numbers from
    // -(27) to 27 - 1, which equals -128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2n - 1,
    // so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.
